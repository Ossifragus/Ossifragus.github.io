abstract = {With the development of modern technologies, it is possible to gather an extraordinarily large number of observations. Due to the storage or transmission burden, big data are usually scattered at multiple locations. It is difficult to transfer all of data to the central server for analysis. A distributed subdata selection method for big data linear regression model is proposed. Particularly, a two-step subsampling strategy with optimal subsampling probabilities and optimal allocation sizes is developed. The subsample-based estimator effectively approximates the ordinary least squares estimator from the full data. The convergence rate and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator are established. Simulation studies and an illustrative example about airline data are provided to assess the performance of the proposed method.}

  abstract = 	 {This paper studies binary logistic regression for rare events data, or imbalanced data, where the number of events (observations in one class, often called cases) is significantly smaller than the number of nonevents (observations in the other class, often called controls). We first derive the asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the unknown parameter, which shows that the asymptotic variance convergences to zero in a rate of the inverse of the number of the events instead of the inverse of the full data sample size, indicating that the available information in rare events data is at the scale of the number of events instead of the full data sample size. Furthermore, we prove that under-sampling a small proportion of the nonevents, the resulting under-sampled estimator may have identical asymptotic distribution to the full data MLE. This demonstrates the advantage of under-sampling nonevents for rare events data, because this procedure may significantly reduce the computation and/or data collection costs. Another common practice in analyzing rare events data is to over-sample (replicate) the events, which has a higher computational cost. We show that this procedure may even result in efficiency loss in terms of parameter estimation.}

We derive the asymptotic distribution of a general subsampling estimator and then derive two versions of optimal subsampling probabilities. One version minimizes the trace of the asymptotic variance-covariance matrix for a linearly transformed parameter estimator and the other minimizes that of the original parameter estimator. The former does not depend on the densities of the responses given covariates and is easy to implement. Algorithms based on optimal subsampling probabilities are proposed and asymptotic distributions, and the asymptotic optimality of the resulting estimators are established. Furthermore, we propose an iterative subsampling procedure based on the optimal subsampling probabilities in the linearly transformed parameter estimation which has great scalability to utilize available computational resources. In addition, this procedure yields standard errors for parameter estimators without estimating the densities of the responses given the covariates. We provide numerical examples based on both simulated and real data to illustrate the proposed method.}",
